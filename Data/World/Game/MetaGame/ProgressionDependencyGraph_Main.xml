	Game Slice dependency graph structure
	==================================
	A game slice is a short gameplay sequence.  ie.  "Talk to Winston", or "Beat up 5 gang"
		- To properly setup the dependency graph, basically you define a list of game slices, and then setup the dependency.
		- A Mission, an Event can be made up of a few game slices
		- An Objective is most likely going to be made up one one (or at most two) game slices

	A game slice is made up of a few components.  Here is an example:
			
		<gameslice name="**GAMESLICE_NAME**">
			<title>**GAMESLICE_TITLE**</title>
			<scriptclass>**GAMESLICE_CLASS**</scriptclass>
			<dependent>**GAMESLICE_NAME**</dependent>   \
			<dependent>**GAMESLICE_NAME**</dependent>    - You can have as many as you want.
			<dependent>**GAMESLICE_NAME**</dependent>   /
			<minimumdependents>**NUMBER**</minimumdependents>
		</gameslice>     
	   
		- **GAMESLICE_NAME** - This is an internal name, so you can pretty much name it anything, BUT it has to be unique, in this file.
		- **GAMESLICE_TITLE** - This is a short caption that would describe this slice.  This will be displayed by the debug Progression UI,
		  so you might want to make it meaningful.  ie. "Talk to Winston" (Without the quotes)
		- **GAMESLICE_CLASS** - This is the directory name of the Skookum class that you want to be using. ie. "BBC_1_Winston" (Without the quotes)
        
		- As you can see above, you can have as many dependent as you want for a game slice.  Whenever you have
		  a dependent, it means THIS game slice, will only be unlocked and run if the dependents are completed.
		- Normally, you will likely want all the dependent game slices to be finished, before your game slice starts,
		  in which case, you can omit the MinimumDependents.
		- Otherwise, if you want this game slice to start when you complete just a few of them, you can specify the MinimumDependents field.
		  An example would be if you want to create a mission and it will unlock as soon as you complete 3 out of 4 objectives.
		  Then you list 4 game slice dependents, and then put in <minimumdependents>3</minimumdependents>
				
	Important Note: Currently the order that you list the game slice in this file is IMPORTANT.

	//    <scriptclass> THIS IS YOUR DIRECTORY NAME  </scriptclass>

	Example that you can copy / paste:
	   
		<gameslice name="S1">
		<title>Socialize with Bouncer</title>
		<scriptclass>Encounter</scriptclass>
		</gameslice>
